This is my project for my microsystems class of a binary clock with Bluetooth 4.0 communication. The PDF is in polish (can provide translation if anyone will ever want it).  
Everything was made using Arduino IDE 1.8.10 and KiCad 5, all on Widows 10.  
Files in here:  
--Dokumentacja.pdf-report on this project, in polish.
--sysmikro.ino-the arduino code, required libs: "LedControl" by Wyoda (http://wayoda.github.io/LedControl/); "RTCLib_by_NeiroN";  
--BTClockController.apk-android app that communicates with BT4.0 module, may or may not work, I had some trouble with it;
--KiCad files from Documents.7z-an archive with all my additional libs and the project itself (GitHub wouldn't let me post it otherwise). As the name indicates, I had it in "MyComputer/Documents";
